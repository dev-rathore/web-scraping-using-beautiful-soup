        Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.
        </li>
      <li>
        These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions) and self-correction.
      </li>
      <li>
        Particular applications of AI include expert systems, speech recognition and machine vision.

      <li>
        AI can be categorized as either weak or strong. Weak AI, also known as narrow AI, is an AI system that is designed and trained for a particular task. Virtual personal assistants, such as Apple's Siri, are a form of weak AI.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strong AI, also known as artificial general intelligence, is an AI system with generalized human cognitive abilities. When presented with an unfamiliar task, a strong AI system is able to find a solution without human intervention.
